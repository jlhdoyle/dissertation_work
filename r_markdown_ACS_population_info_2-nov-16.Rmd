This document is for detailing the steps I used to obtain population counts from American Community Survey (hereafter ACS) data for the sample set of 149 MSAs being used in my dissertation research.

The first thing I did was load the required ACS data, previously downloaded from the Census website. I took the 5-year ACS data, Hispanic or Latino Origin by MSA, using [this query](http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/12_5YR/B03003/0100000US.31000.005) and saved the result to my hard drive. As I did with the SBO data, I'll then filter it so that I have a table with only my 149 sample MSAs.

```r{get_acs_2012_data}
ACS_2012_B03003 <- read.csv("/home/jessica/Documents/dissertation_Orchid/data_storage/ACS/ACS_12_5YR_B03003/ACS_12_5YR_B03003_with_ann.csv", as.is = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
ACS_2012_filtered <- semi_join(ACS_2012_B03003, geoID2only, by = "GEO.id2")
write.csv(ACS_2012_filtered, "/home/jessica/Documents/dissertation_Orchid/calculations/MSA_population_ACS_2012_B03003.csv")
```

The geoID2only dataset was previously created to give me the identification numbers stored under "GEO.id2" for each MSA, for only my 149 sample MSAs.

In order to make sure to compare the same dataset, I chose B01003 for both the 2005-07 and 2010-12 periods.

```r{apples_to_apples}
ACS_2007_B01003 <- read.csv("/home/jessica/Documents/dissertation_Orchid/data_storage/ACS/ACS_07_3YR_B01003_by_MSA/ACS_07_3YR_B01003_with_ann.csv", as.is = TRUE)
ACS_2007_B01003_filtered <- semi_join(ACS_2007_B01003, geoID2only, by = "GEO.id2")
write.csv(ACS_2007_B01003_filtered, "/home/jessica/Documents/dissertation_Orchid/calculations/msa_total_population_2007_ACS.csv")
ACS_2012_B01003 <- read.csv("/home/jessica/Documents/dissertation_Orchid/data_storage/ACS/ACS_12_3YR_B01003_by_MSA/ACS_12_3YR_B01003_with_ann.csv", as.is = TRUE)
ACS_2012_B01003_filtered <- semi_join(ACS_2012_B01003, geoID2only, by = "GEO.id2")
write.csv(ACS_2012_B01003_filtered, "/home/jessica/Documents/dissertation_Orchid/calculations/msa_total_population_2012_ACS_B01003.csv")
```
